- 👋 Hi, I’m @sosmarc. Let me say that "I had a dream". That one day I'd be sharing my code with the community and supporting their work despite I'm aware that I'm more a programming enthusiast than a real one.
However, I've realised that even the most humble code snippet may make the difference helping us saving a lot of time coding the auxiliary parts of a program and sometimes even making us
loosing the big picture of what we are actually trying to accomplish. This is what I'm trying to share with you: Small pieces of code that someone eventually might find useful and want to apply into their
own codes and also improve them to ease their use to the community.
Maybe, if I arm myself with patience and skills, I'll try to turn this pieces of code in an actual library. Who knows...
- 👀 I’m a Chemical Engineer with a Master's Degree in Numerical Methods and Artificial Intelligence and a PhD in Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics (Everything seems consistent, right? :wink:).
My research activity has been diverse. In the first place I worked in optimization of maintenance and inspection policy based on risk and availability criteria (RAMS). Afterwards, 
in a related area, I worked in the predictive diagnosis of industrial assets' failures (wind turbines in my case) applying machine learning. Then, and until today, I've been researching in merging physical and 
ML models for thermodynamic properties prediction. This Frankenstenian hybridation of ML and physics has become an actual passion of mine.
- 🌱 Beacuse ML and specially DL is evolving every day at a giant pace, :rocket:, I'm trying to update myself to the latest developments of the field. I've started introducing CNN to my
research toolbox and also digging into causality (this latter topic is for, hopefully, future endevours).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any ML and DL applications to meaningful scientific and technical problems. In what is close to my current research (Chem. Eng. Thermodynamics), 
I'll be happy to collaborate with anyone interested in developing predictive hybrid ML/DL-physical models for molecular design.
- 📫 If you'd like to contact me to critize my code, please, don't. For compliments and potential collaborations email me to: adriel.sosa@outlook.es :grin::thumbsup:
