- 👋 Hi, I’m @sosmarc.
- 👀 I’m a Chemical Engineer with a Master's Degree in Numerical Methods and Artificial Intelligence and a PhD in Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics.
My research activity has been diverse. In the first place, I worked in maintenance and inspection policy optimization based on risk and availability criteria (RAMS). Afterwards, 
in a related area, I worked on the predictive diagnosis of industrial assets' failures (wind turbines in my case) applying machine learning. 
- 🌱 Then, and until today, I've been researching in merging physical and DL models for physicochemical properties prediction. I currently lead research programs in AI-based drug discovery combining discriminative and generative AI. Part of my expertise is related to probabilistic deep learning, geometric deep learning and evolutionary optimization.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any ML and DL applications to meaningful scientific and technical problems.
- 📫 If you'd like to contact me to critize my code, please, don't. For compliments and potential collaborations email me to: adriel.sosa@outlook.es :grin::thumbsup:
